EDA - Terrorism

Objective:

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

# RESULT
Terrorist acts in the Middle East and northern Africa have been seen to have fatal consequences. The Middle East and North Africa are seen to be the places of serious terrorist attacks. In addition, even though there is a perception that Muslims are supporters of terrorism, Muslims are the people who are most damaged by terrorist attacks. If you look at the graphics, it appears that Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the most damaged countries. All of these countries are Muslim countries.
