# SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION
## Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a machine learning project that aims to detect and classify human emotions from spoken language. In Python, you'd typically start by collecting a labeled dataset of speech samples, preprocess the data, extract relevant features (e.g., MFCCs), and then build and train a machine learning model (e.g., using deep learning techniques like CNNs or RNNs). Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Finally, deploy the trained model for real-time emotion recognition from speech.
